# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect the Receivables App and ensure proper authentication and authorization using the Supabase client-side SDK.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication System

#### JWT Token Verification
- All database operations require valid JWT tokens from Supabase
- Tokens are verified client-side using Supabase's auth SDK
- Automatic token refresh handling to prevent session expiration
- Proper error handling for invalid or expired tokens

#### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in through Supabase Auth
2. Frontend receives JWT token and stores it securely
3. All database operations use the authenticated Supabase client
4. Client verifies token with Supabase before processing requests
5. If token is invalid/expired, user is automatically signed out

### 2. Authorization System

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User Role**: Can only access/modify their own data
- **Admin Role**: Can access/modify all data
- Role checking implemented in all database operations

#### Data Isolation
- Users can only view receivables they created
- Users can only view payments related to their receivables
- Admin users have full access to all data

### 3. Client-Side Protection

#### Protected Pages
All dashboard pages are protected:
- `/receivables` - Receivables management
- `/payments` - Payments management
- `/customers` - Customer management

#### Security Middleware
- Middleware checks for valid session cookies on protected pages
- Automatic redirection to login for unauthenticated requests
- Session validation using Supabase cookies

### 4. Input Validation

#### Request Validation
- All required fields are validated
- Data type validation (numbers, strings, dates)
- SQL injection prevention through Supabase's parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper input sanitization

#### Business Logic Validation
- Amount validation (must be positive numbers)
- Date format validation and normalization
- Customer name and city validation (non-empty strings)

### 5. Error Handling

#### Secure Error Responses
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Proper error handling for database operations
- Detailed error logging for debugging (client-side only)

#### Authentication Error Handling
- Automatic sign-out on token expiration
- Clear error messages for authentication failures
- Graceful degradation on authentication failures

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side API Service (`app/lib/api.ts`)

```typescript
// Get current authenticated user
async function getCurrentUser()

// Refresh token if needed
async function refreshTokenIfNeeded()

// API functions with built-in authentication
export const receivablesApi = {
  getAll: async (customer?: string)
  getById: async (id: string)
  create: async (data: any)
  update: async (id: string, data: any)
  delete: async (id: string)
}
```

### Database Operation Protection

All database operations use the authenticated Supabase client:

```typescript
// Example: Get receivables with user filtering
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('receivables')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id) // Only user's data
  .order('date', { ascending: false });
```

### Frontend API Integration (`app/lib/api.ts`)

- Automatic token refresh
- User authentication verification
- Error handling for expired sessions
- Type-safe API functions
- Built-in authorization checks

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Token Management
- Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration
- Invalid tokens trigger automatic sign-out
- No token storage in localStorage (uses Supabase session)

### 2. Data Access Control
- Row-level security through application logic
- User can only access their own data
- Admin override for system-wide access
- Permission checks before all database operations

### 3. Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention through Supabase ORM
- XSS prevention through proper encoding

### 4. Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error responses
- Proper logging for security events
- Graceful degradation on authentication failures

## Database Security

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
The database schema should include RLS policies:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for receivables
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own receivables" ON receivables
FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admin override
CREATE POLICY "Admins can access all receivables" ON receivables
FOR ALL USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM auth.users 
    WHERE id = auth.uid() 
    AND raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin'
  )
);
```

### Audit Trail
- All records include `user_id` and `created_at` fields
- Timestamps for creation and updates
- Full audit trail for compliance

## Testing Security

### Authentication Tests
- Test with valid JWT tokens
- Test with invalid/expired tokens
- Test with missing authentication

### Authorization Tests
- Test user access to own data
- Test user access to other users' data (should be denied)
- Test admin access to all data

### Input Validation Tests
- Test with malformed data
- Test with SQL injection attempts
- Test with XSS payloads

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events
- Failed authentication attempts
- Authorization violations
- Invalid token usage
- Unusual access patterns

### Audit Logs
- All database operations logged with user context
- Data modification events
- Authentication events

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance
- User data isolation
- Right to be forgotten (data deletion)
- Data access controls

### SOX Compliance
- Audit trails for financial data
- Access controls for sensitive information
- Data integrity validation

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. Rate limiting for database operations
2. IP-based access controls
3. Multi-factor authentication
4. Advanced threat detection
5. Automated security scanning

### Security Headers
Implement additional security headers:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Procedures
1. Immediate token invalidation
2. User notification
3. Security audit
4. Vulnerability assessment
5. Patch deployment
